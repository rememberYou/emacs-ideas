## Why?

GNU Emacs is above all a community that uses the same text editor. Some
developers lack ideas while others abound, without finding the time or skills
for development.

This repository allows us to centralize all the ideas that would improve GNU
Emacs so that it can satisfy us more on a daily basis. After all, don't we say
that nothing is impossible with GNU Emacs?

## How can I contribute?

Whether you have a new idea or want to complement other people's ideas, it will
help everyone.

In order to better track ideas and know which ideas are already developed as
packages, you only have to open or complete an issue in the issue tracker.

To help the best understanding, it is necessary to respect a certain
template. Take this [issue](https://github.com/rememberYou/emacs-ideas/issues/1)
as an example.
